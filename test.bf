# ⚠️ Incomplete code 😢
# write a brain fuck program to collect 2 numbers and return the sum
# STEP 1 print("A:"):

# increase set p0 to 10, then begin a loop
#   go to the p1, increase p1 by 6
#   go back to p0, reduce by 1
# when p0 is 0, move to p1; p1 = 60

# to print a, add 5 to p1
+++++.

# p1 is 65, reduce to 58
-------.

# lets reset p1 to 0

# move to p2 then ask for number. print the number out too so the user sees it, then move back to p0

# print new line; p0 is 10, then set back to 0
